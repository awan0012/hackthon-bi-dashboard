Building a modern data streaming architecture on AWS involves several steps, including setting up the data streaming pipeline, storing and processing the data, 
and creating a dashboard to visualize the data. Here is a step-by-step process to build a modern data streaming architecture on AWS and create a dashboard with it:

Step 1: Choose a Data Streaming Service
AWS offers several data streaming services, including Amazon Kinesis, Amazon MSK, and Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK). 
Choose the service that best fits your requirements.

Step 2: Set up the Data Streaming Pipeline
Create a Kinesis stream, configure the stream to receive data, and create a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to store the data in S3. 
You can also use AWS Glue to transform the data and store it in a database.

Step 3: Store and Process the Data
Store the data in Amazon S3, which is highly scalable and durable. 
You can also use Amazon EMR or AWS Glue to process the data in real-time or batch mode.

Step 4: Create a Dashboard
To create a dashboard, you can use Amazon QuickSight, which is a cloud-based business intelligence service. 
Connect to the data source (S3 bucket or database) and create the visualizations.

Here is a step-by-step process to create a dashboard using Amazon QuickSight:

Step 1: Create a QuickSight Account
If you don't have a QuickSight account, create one by signing up for the service.

Step 2: Connect to the Data Source
In QuickSight, choose the data source (S3 bucket or database) that you want to connect to. 
Provide the necessary credentials and select the tables or files you want to use.

Step 3: Create Visualizations
Choose the type of visualization you want to create, such as a bar chart or a line chart. 
Select the fields to be displayed and configure the visualization options.

Step 4: Publish the Dashboard
After creating the visualizations, publish the dashboard by clicking the "Publish" button. 
You can share the dashboard with other users by providing them with the dashboard URL.

In conclusion, building a modern data streaming architecture on AWS involves several steps, including setting up the data streaming pipeline, storing 
and processing the data, and creating a dashboard to visualize the data. By following the above steps, you can easily create a dashboard to visualize the data 
and gain insights into your data streaming architecture.
